// Add your setup.js logic here! You can use the beforeAll and afterAll hooks to run
// something before/after **a describe block** runs.

/**
 * Notes:
 *
 * - Using beforeAll and afterAll might be tricky here if you want to do something
 * to the global state of your application. Ensure you don't wipe out your whole
 * database here!
 *
 * - If you want to remove data and multiple describe tests depend on them,
 * consider adding individual beforeAll and afterAll tests on each describe block!
 * See the test suites for an example.
